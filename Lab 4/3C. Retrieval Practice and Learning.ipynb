    "# Retrieval Practice and Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the most effective way to learn a subject? Many students focus exclusively on the _encoding_ process---that is, how to get the knowledge into memory in the first place. For example, taking notes is an activity for encoding knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Retrieval_, on the other hand, is the process of reconstructing that knowledge from memory. [Karpicke and Blunt](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/772) (2011) demonstrated that _retrieval_ is more effective for learning than activites designed to promote effective encoding. They conducted an experiment in which subjects had to learn about sea otters by reading a passage. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: some were instructed to create a [concept map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map) as they read the passage, while others were instructed to practice retrieval (i.e., read the passage, recall as much as they could, read the text again, and recall again). The two main measurements they recorded were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. each subject's score on a follow-up learning test one week later\n",
    "2. each subject's _prediction_ of how well they would do on that test\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will analyze data from a _replication_ of Karpicke and Blunt's experiment, conducted by Buttrick _et al_.\n",
    "- The data file is : data.csv.\n",
    "- The codebook (explaining what the variables mean) is : codebook.csv."
